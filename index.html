      <p>My undergraduate degree is in Speech Pathology and Audiology; my graduate degree is in Education with a major in Adult Learning and Development.  However, I have 35 plus years of experience in the technology field.  I started out as a Computer Operator and Tutor at a local Community College.  Later, I was hired by the State Data Center as a Programmer Analyst.  After almost one year, I was hired by a local University as a Programmer Analyst.  During my tenure at the University I also worked as a Systems Analyst and finally a Database Administrator.  I have installed, upgraded, and maintained Oracle Databases that ran on NT and Unix operating systems.  I have also installed, upgraded, and maintained Oracle PeopleSoft Financials applications and Oracle PeopleSoft Student applications.</p>
